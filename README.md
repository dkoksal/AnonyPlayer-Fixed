AnonyPlayer-Fixed
=================

I like the idea of internet radio over Tor hidden services, but there are some sort of glaring things I would do differently with the AnonyPlayer used by Deep Web Radio. I am not the original author of this code, nor do I know who the original author is. I would welcome contact and will be setting up a TorChat instance expressly for that purpose which will be listed in the README.
